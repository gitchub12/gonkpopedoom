8 Claude rules
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you check off as you complete.
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on todo items, marking them complete as you go.
5. Every step of the way just give me a non-coder beginner-level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Make every code change as simple as possible and keep new code short. Every change should impact as few files and as little code as possible.
7. I cannot generally make edits to code, so you will present complete files so I can replace old ones and set artifact ID exactly as the requested filename for correct downloads.
8. After every action give a complete list with links to your altered files I need to download to test, then the percent of chat remaining at a simple %.
